# web-scraper-prnt.sc

This is a web scraper for the site: prnt.sc/ that generates a random working image url from this site, then pulls it and displays the image (currently just the url in text).This is the very basic part of my project. 
I intend on making it into an actual web page that displays these random images on refresh.

This web scraper uses the JSoup API to parse HTML pages.
